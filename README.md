gmd — Go-based Docker Manager (TUI)

gmd is a fast, minimal, terminal-native Docker manager written in Go.
It provides a clean TUI experience for listing, inspecting, updating, and operating Docker containers and images — without needing Portainer or a browser.

This project uses:
	•	Bubble Tea (for TUI state machine)
	•	Lipgloss (for styling)
	•	Docker SDK for Go (container & image operations)
	•	Model Stack architecture (for navigation between screens)

📦 Features

Real-time Docker monitoring
	•	Initial snapshot of containers and images
	•	Live event listener for Docker (create, start, pull, die, destroy, etc.)
	•	Automatic UI refresh on changes

Images panel
	•	Displays images similarly to Portainer (grouped, sorted, tagged)
	•	Detects unused images
	•	Supports deletion with UI feedback
	•	Detailed rendering with Lipgloss styling

Containers panel
	•	Name, ShortID, status, and update availability flags
	•	Colored status indicators (running/exited/restarting/paused)
	•	Live refresh on events
	•	Trigger updates via keyboard (u)

Interactive container update workflow

Full update pipeline implemented in a dedicated model:
	1.	docker pull with per-layer progress bars
	2.	Stop container with spinner
	3.	Remove container
	4.	Recreate container from its previous inspect
	5.	Start container
	6.	Return to main UI when complete

Includes:
	•	bubbles/progress for per-layer bars
	•	Spinners for blocking steps
	•	Clean multi-line logs during update
	•	A spinUntilDone helper for long operations

Shell and logs from TUI
	•	Exit the alt-screen and open a real shell inside a container (exec)
	•	Tail logs directly using Bubble Tea subprocess integration
